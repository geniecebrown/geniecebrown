# Geniece Brown</a>'s Project Portfolio 👩🏾‍💻

I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a growing interest in how technology works and helping to keep it secure.

After completing a hands-on cybersecurity bootcamp and building foundational skills through labs and real-world simulations, I have developed a deeper interest in vulnerability management and a greater awareness of both physical and digital security.

I've expanded my skills by building vulnerability management and threat hunting projects using tools like Tenable, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Sentinel, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. I am also studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification.
